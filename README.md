# lM386 Audio Amplifier
This project is a simple 2 channel audio amp built around 2 LM386 1 Watt audio amplifiers.

The input to this amplifier is from a 2 channel computer audio output. The output is to 2 small speakers. The amplifier can be driven from a single supply ranging from +5V to +15V.

The final product was functional however slightly quiet. The LM386 amplifier IC's are best used as headphone amplifiers. I chose to use them since a very simple and small circuit could be desgined with them.

In the future I intend to create a new more powerful amplifier using discrete transistors instead.

The datasheet for the LM386 audio amplifier can be found [here](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm386.pdf).
